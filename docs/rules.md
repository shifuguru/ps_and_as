# Rules – Presidents & Arseholes

## Objective
Empty your hand first. Next round, ranks: President, VP, ... Arsehole.

## Turn basics
- Players must beat the current top set or **pass**.
- A "set" is {N of a kind} or a **run** (sequence) when allowed.

## Sets
- Singles: any rank. Jokers (if used) are highest.
- Doubles/Triples/Quads: must match count to beat (e.g., double beats double).

## Runs (this variant)
- **Definition:** A consecutive sequence of 3+ cards of the *same count* (e.g., 3-4-5-6 singles; or 5♦-5♣ + 6♦-6♣ + 7♦-7♣ as doubles).
- **No wraps** (K-A-2 is invalid unless house rule).
- **To beat a run:** same length & count; strictly higher sequence.
- **Bombs (optional):** four-of-a-kind beats any set/run; clears the pile.

## Passing
- You may pass; you’re locked out until the pile clears.

## Edge cases
- 2s are highest singles; cannot be in runs.
- Reset on clear; next player may lead any legal set.

## Examples
- Lead: 4-5-6 (singles). Beating plays: 6-7-8, 7-8-9. **Not allowed:** 7-8 (too short), pair run, or 4-5-6 of mixed counts.
