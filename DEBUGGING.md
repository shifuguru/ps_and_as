# Network Debugging Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you debug multiplayer networking issues in Presidents & Assholes using the built-in debug tools.

## Debug Panel

### Accessing the Debug Panel
Both **Find Game** and **Create Game** screens now have a debug panel:

1. Look for the **üîç Debug** button in the top-right corner
2. Tap to expand the debug panel
3. View real-time connection info, room data, and error messages
4. Tap **‚úï** to collapse

### Debug Info Sections

#### Find Game Screen
- **Connection Status**
  - `status`: disconnected | connecting | connected
  - `playerId`: Your unique GameCenter or device ID
  - `adapterType`: SocketAdapter or MockAdapter
  
- **Discovery Info**
  - `roomsFound`: Number of available games
  - `isSearching`: Whether actively searching
  - `discoveryCount`: Total discovery requests made
  - `lastDiscovery`: Timestamp of last successful discovery

- **Available Rooms**
  - List of all discoverable games with host names and player counts

- **Error**
  - Last error message received

#### Create Game Screen
- **Connection Status**
  - `status`: disconnected | connecting | connected
  - `playerId`: Your GameCenter/device ID
  - `localId`: Socket ID assigned by server
  - `hostId`: Socket ID of game host
  - `isHost`: Whether you are the host
  - `roomCreated`: Whether room was successfully created

- **Lobby Info**
  - `playerCount`: Number of players in lobby
  - `players`: Array of player names
  - `localReady`: Your ready status

## Console Logging

All network operations are logged to the console with tagged prefixes:

```
[App] - App.tsx events
[FindGame] - Find Game screen events
[CreateGame] - Create Game screen events
[SocketAdapter] - Socket.IO adapter events
[GameCenter] - Player authentication events
```

### Viewing Console Logs

#### In Expo Dev Tools:
1. Start app: `npm start`
2. Look for logs in the terminal
3. Or open browser console at `http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui`

#### On Device (with React Native Debugger):
1. Shake device
2. Select "Debug"
3. View Chrome DevTools console

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No games found nearby"

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open debug panel in Find Game
2. Check **Connection Status** ‚Üí `status`
   - If `disconnected`: Server not reachable
   - If `connecting`: Still attempting connection
   - If `connected`: Successfully connected

3. Check **Discovery Info** ‚Üí `discoveryCount`
   - If `0`: Discovery requests not being sent
   - If increasing: Requests are working

4. Check console for:
   ```
   [SocketAdapter] Connecting to: http://...
   [SocketAdapter] Connected! Socket ID: ...
   [SocketAdapter] Emitting discoverRooms...
   [SocketAdapter] Received availableRooms: [...]
   ```

**Solutions:**
- **Server not running**: Start server with `cd server && node index.js`
- **Wrong IP address**: Update IP in `App.tsx` line ~24
- **Firewall blocking**: Allow port 3000 in firewall
- **Network mismatch**: Ensure device and server on same WiFi

### Issue: Created game not appearing in Find Game

**Debug Steps:**
1. Create a game on Device A
2. Check debug panel:
   - `roomCreated`: should be `true`
   - `connectionStatus`: should be `"connected"`
   - `localId`: should have a value

3. On Device B, open Find Game
4. Check console on Device B:
   ```
   [FindGame] Available rooms: [...]
   ```

5. Check server console:
   ```
   conn <socket-id>
   createRoom event received
   ```

**Solutions:**
- **Room not public**: Ensure `isPublic: true` in createRoom call (default)
- **Server not broadcasting**: Restart server
- **Multiple server instances**: Kill old server processes
- **Adapter mismatch**: Ensure both devices use SocketAdapter, not MockAdapter

### Issue: "Connection failed" error

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check debug panel ‚Üí Connection Status
2. Look for console error:
   ```
   [SocketAdapter] Connection error: ...
   ```

**Solutions:**
- **Server offline**: Verify server running with `netstat -an | findstr :3000`
- **CORS issue**: Server allows `origin: '*'` (already configured)
- **Timeout**: Increase connection timeout in SocketAdapter
- **SSL issue**: Use `http://` not `https://` for local connections

### Issue: GameCenter authentication failing

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check console:
   ```
   [GameCenter] Module loaded successfully
   [GameCenter] Player authenticated: {...}
   ```
   OR
   ```
   [GameCenter] Not available (expo-game-center not installed)
   [GameCenter] Using fallback ID: device-...
   ```

**Solutions:**
- **iOS only**: GameCenter only works on iOS, Android uses fallback
- **Not signed in**: Sign in to GameCenter in iOS Settings
- **Sandbox mode**: Use sandbox GameCenter account for development
- **Fallback is OK**: App works fine without GameCenter using device IDs

## Testing Checklist

### Local Network Test (2 Devices)
- [ ] Server running: `cd server && node index.js`
- [ ] Correct IP in App.tsx: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`
- [ ] Both devices on same WiFi
- [ ] Device A: Create Game ‚Üí Debug shows "connected"
- [ ] Device B: Find Game ‚Üí See Device A's game in list
- [ ] Device B: Join game ‚Üí Both appear in Create Game lobby
- [ ] Device A: Start game ‚Üí Game begins on both devices

### Debug Panel Test
- [ ] Debug button visible in top-right
- [ ] Panel expands when tapped
- [ ] Connection status updates in real-time
- [ ] Room count updates automatically
- [ ] Error messages appear when issues occur
- [ ] Panel can be collapsed

### Console Logging Test
- [ ] See `[FindGame]` logs when searching
- [ ] See `[CreateGame]` logs when creating
- [ ] See `[SocketAdapter]` logs for socket events
- [ ] See `[GameCenter]` logs on app launch
- [ ] Errors logged with full stack traces

## Advanced Debugging

### Manual Room Discovery
In Find Game screen, tap the **üîÑ Refresh** button to manually trigger room discovery.

### Server-Side Debugging
In `server/index.js`, all socket events are logged:
```javascript
console.log('conn', socket.id);        // New connection
console.log('createRoom', roomId);     // Room created
console.log('joinRoom', roomId);       // Player joined
console.log('discoverRooms');          // Discovery requested
```

### Network Inspection
Use Reactotron or Flipper to inspect Socket.IO events:
1. Install Reactotron: `npm install --save-dev reactotron-react-native`
2. Add to socketAdapter.ts:
   ```typescript
   Reactotron.log('Socket Event', eventName, data);
   ```

### Mock Adapter Testing
To test without a server:
1. In `App.tsx`, replace SocketAdapter with MockAdapter
2. Create multiple MockAdapter instances for different "players"
3. Use `discoverRooms()` to see mock rooms

```typescript
const mockAdapter = new MockAdapter();
mockAdapter.createRoom("test-1", "Host Player");
mockAdapter.discoverRooms();
// Check console for availableRooms event
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Discovery Refresh Rate
Default: Every 3 seconds

To change, edit `FindGame.tsx`:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  // ...
}, 3000); // Change this value (milliseconds)
```

### Connection Timeout
Socket.IO default: 20 seconds

To change, edit `socketAdapter.ts`:
```typescript
this.socket = socketIo(this.url, {
  timeout: 10000 // 10 seconds
});
```

## Troubleshooting Flowchart

```
No games found?
  ‚îú‚îÄ Server running? 
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Start server
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Continue
  ‚îú‚îÄ Connected? (Check debug panel)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Check IP address, firewall
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Continue
  ‚îú‚îÄ Discovery count increasing?
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Check discoverRooms() implementation
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Continue
  ‚îî‚îÄ Any games actually created?
      ‚îú‚îÄ No ‚Üí Create a game first!
      ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Check server logs for broadcast
```

## Getting Help

When reporting issues, include:
1. Screenshot of debug panel
2. Console logs (last 50 lines)
3. Server console output
4. Device OS and network type
5. App version / commit hash

Example report:
```
