# Multiplayer System Changes - Summary

## What Was Implemented

### âœ… Server-Side Changes (server/index.js)

#### 1. **Host Migration System**
- When host disconnects, server automatically assigns new host to first available player
- New `migrateHost()` function handles transfer of host privileges
- Emits `hostMigrated` event to notify all clients
- Host can be different from original after disconnection

#### 2. **Disconnection Grace Period**
- **60-second grace period** for players to reconnect during active games
- Players marked with `disconnectedAt` timestamp instead of immediate removal
- `schedulePlayerRemoval()` waits 60s before permanently removing player
- Different behavior for lobby vs in-game disconnections:
  - **Lobby**: Immediate removal (no grace period)
  - **In-Game**: 60s grace period, host migration, player state preserved

#### 3. **Reconnection Support**
- `joinRoom` detects returning players by matching name
- Restores player's `socketId` and clears `disconnectedAt`
- Sends full `gameStateSync` to reconnected player
- Preserves host status for returning hosts if host hasn't migrated

#### 4. **Game Action Broadcasting**
- New `gameAction` event handler on server
- Server validates player identity and broadcasts actions to all clients
- Ensures synchronized game state across all players
- Server tracks `gameState` and `inGame` status per room

#### 5. **Enhanced Room Management**
- Rooms track additional state:
  - `gameState`: Server-side game data
  - `inGame`: Boolean for active game status
  - `disconnectedAt`: Timestamp for disconnected players
- Better cleanup of empty rooms
- Player list includes `disconnected` status in updates

### âœ… Client-Side Changes (src/game/socketAdapter.ts)

#### 1. **New Event Listeners**
Added handlers for:
- `hostMigrated` - New host assigned
- `playerDisconnected` - Player lost connection, grace period started
- `playerRemoved` - Player permanently removed
- `gameAction` - Game move from any player (server-validated)
- `gameStateSync` - Full state sync on reconnection

#### 2. **New Methods**
- `sendGameAction(roomId, action)` - Send game moves through server
- `requestGameState(roomId)` - Request full state sync
- `toggleReady()` - Already existed, preserved

## What Still Needs Implementation

### ðŸ”„ GameScreen.tsx Updates Required

The GameScreen component needs to be updated to use the new multiplayer system:

#### 1. **Handle Host Migration**
```typescript
if (ev.state.type === "hostMigrated") {
  setHostId(ev.state.newHost);
  // Update UI to reflect new host
  Alert.alert("Host Changed", `${ev.state.newHostName} is now the host`);
}
```

#### 2. **Show Disconnection Status**
```typescript
if (ev.state.type === "playerDisconnected") {
  // Show indicator that player is disconnected but may return
  setPlayerStatus(ev.state.playerId, 'disconnected');
  // Optional: Show countdown timer for grace period
}
```

#### 3. **Handle Player Removal**
```typescript
if (ev.state.type === "playerRemoved") {
  // Remove player from game
  // May need to adjust game state if it's their turn
  const newState = removePlayer(state, ev.state.playerId);
  setState(newState);
}
```

#### 4. **Send Actions Through Server**
Replace direct state updates with server synchronization:

**Before:**
```typescript
const next = playCards(state, humanPlayer.id, cards);
setState(next);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Send to server
if (adapter && (adapter as any).sendGameAction) {
  (adapter as any).sendGameAction(actualRoomId, {
    type: 'play',
    playerId: humanPlayer.id,
    cards: cards
  });
}

// Apply when server broadcasts back
if (ev.state.type === "gameAction") {
  if (ev.state.action.type === 'play') {
    const next = playCards(state, ev.state.action.playerId, ev.state.action.cards);
    setState(next);
  }
}
```

#### 5. **Request State Sync on Reconnection**
```typescript
// When component mounts or reconnects
useEffect(() => {
  if (adapter && actualRoomId && (adapter as any).requestGameState) {
    (adapter as any).requestGameState(actualRoomId);
  }
}, []);

// Handle incoming sync
if (ev.state.type === "gameStateSync") {
  setState(ev.state.gameState);
}
```

### ðŸ”„ CreateGame.tsx Updates

Minor updates needed:

1. **Show Disconnected Status in Player List**
```typescript
{names.map((item, index) => {
  const player = lobbyPlayers.find(p => p.name === item);
  const isDisconnected = player?.disconnected;
  
  return (
    <View key={item + index}>
      <Text style={{ 
        color: isDisconnected ? "rgba(255,255,255,0.4)" : "white" 
      }}>
        {index + 1}. {item}
        {isDisconnected && " (disconnected)"}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
})}
```

2. **Handle Host Migration in Lobby**
```typescript
if (ev.type === "state" && ev.state.type === "hostMigrated") {
  setHostId(ev.state.newHost);
  if (ev.state.newHost === localId) {
    Alert.alert("You're Now Host", "You can now start the game");
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Create room with 2+ players
- [ ] Start game successfully
- [ ] Players can see each other's moves in real-time

### Host Migration
- [ ] Host disconnects, new host is assigned
- [ ] New host can control game
- [ ] Original host rejoins as regular player

### Disconnection Handling
- [ ] Player disconnects during game
- [ ] Other players see "disconnected" status
- [ ] Player reconnects within 60s successfully
- [ ] Player state and hand preserved on reconnect
- [ ] Player removed after 60s if no reconnection

### Edge Cases
- [ ] All players disconnect simultaneously
- [ ] Host disconnects and reconnects multiple times
- [ ] Player disconnects during their turn
- [ ] Room with only 2 players, one disconnects

## Migration Guide for Existing Code

### If You Have Active Development Branches

1. **Pull these changes to your branch**
2. **Update GameScreen.tsx** following the patterns in "What Still Needs Implementation"
3. **Test with at least 2 devices/browsers** to verify synchronization
4. **Monitor console logs** for multiplayer events

### If You're Starting Fresh

The server is ready to use! Just:
1. Start server: `cd server && node index.js`
2. Update GameScreen to use `sendGameAction()` instead of direct state updates
3. Add UI indicators for disconnected players
4. Test reconnection scenarios

## Configuration

### Grace Period Duration
Change in `server/index.js`:
```javascript
const DISCONNECT_GRACE_PERIOD = 60 * 1000; // 60 seconds
// Change to 30 * 1000 for 30 seconds, etc.
```

### Server URL
Change in client code when creating SocketAdapter:
```typescript
const adapter = new SocketAdapter(
  "http://localhost:3000", // Change to your server URL
  roomId,
  playerName
);
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Game Logic Not Fully Server-Side**: Game state calculations still happen on clients. Server just broadcasts actions. This means clients must trust each other not to cheat. Full server-side validation would require porting the entire game logic to the server.

2. **No Persistence**: Game state is lost if server restarts. Consider adding database persistence for production.

3. **No Authentication**: Players identified only by name. Could allow impersonation. Add proper auth for production.

4. **No Spectator Mode**: Disconnected players can't watch after grace period expires.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement GameScreen changes** (highest priority)
2. **Test with multiple real devices** (second priority)
3. **Add UI polish** for disconnection indicators
4. **Consider full server-side game logic** for competitive play
5. **Add database persistence** for game history/stats

**Status**: Server-side infrastructure complete âœ…  
**Status**: Client integration in progress ðŸ”„  
**Ready for testing**: Once GameScreen updates are applied
